# temperature-analysis
The objective of this exercise is to understand the human role on global warming by analyzing the evolution of temperatures on different time scales.

# Temperature evolution since 1880
When we analyse the evolution of temperature since 1880, we see correlation between human activity and the rise of global temperatures.
We note that:
 - The use of fossil fuels has been growing rapidly since the industrial revolution;
 - All the new energies available, particularly nuclear and renewable energies, do not replace the more polluting energies but rather add to them.

# Temperature change over 800,000 years
  # Source data
The basic data is taken from this site which provides information on the last 800,000 years:
[ðŸ”— The evolution of temperatures](https://www.temperaturerecord.org/#sources)
 The evolution of greenhouse gas concentrations (ðŸ”— [CO2](https://www.co2levels.org/), [ðŸ”— methane](https://www.methanelevels.org/), and [ðŸ”— protoxide nitrogen - NO2](https://www.n2olevels.org/))
Note - The data has been reconstructed through ice-core drilling and sedimentary analysis.
